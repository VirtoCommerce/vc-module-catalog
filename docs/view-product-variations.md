### Asset inheritance
When a user creates a product variation it automatically inherits all assets and their properties from a parent product. All subsequent updates in the parent product assets are reflected in the variation assets. After the user edits or adds a new asset to the variation product the inheritance stops being automatic, the system makes a copy of parent assest and adds them to the variation so changes in the parent assets are no longer reflected in the variaiton's.
