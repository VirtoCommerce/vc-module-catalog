**SKU**- Stock Keeping Unit
SKUs are used by catalogs, online e-tailers, warehouses, and product fulfillment centers to track inventory levels in order to determine which products require reordering. Although SKUs differ from model numbers, businesses may embed model numbers within SKUs.


**Important**: By adding SKUs to every product variation, store owners can easily track the quantity of available products and create threshold limits to let them know when new purchase orders must be made.

**GTIN**- Global Trade Item Number
GTIN can be used by a company to uniquely identify all of its trade items.  Currently, GTIN is used exclusively within bar codes.

**Can be purchased** - when this parameter is set for a product on admin side, the item will be available for purchasing on store side. If this parameter is not set on admin side, the item may be visible but not available for purchasing.
