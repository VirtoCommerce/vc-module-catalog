# Manage Search Index

Each document is stored in the index, and has the type and ID. The document is a JSON object that contains zero or more fields or key-value pairs. The original JSON document indexing will be stored in the field_source that returns a default receipt or document search.

The analysis is performed by Ð° custom analyzer defined by index. Token filter:
- custom_edge_ngram (default) 
- custome_ngram

Mapping is used to define how a document and its fields are stored and indexed.
